# movie-info-tmdb
An application which displays movie information.

Project done as a part of CSE-5335 Web Data Management Course at UTA.

Demo of the project can be found <a href="https://movie-info-tmdb.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>.

The problem statement is as follows:

<p align="justify">Your project is to develop a web application to get information about movies, their cast, their posters,etc. This application should be developed using plain JavaScript and Ajax. You should not use anyJavaScript library, such as JQuery. Note that everything should be done asynchronously and your webpage should never be redrawn/refreshed completely. This means that the buttons or any other inputelement in your HTML forms must have JavaScript actions, and should not be regular HTTP requests.</p>
<p align="justify">Your application should have a text section where one can type a movie title (eg, The Matrix), one "Display Info" button to search, one section to display the search results, and one section to displayinformation about a movie. The search results is an itemized clickable list of movie titles along with their years they were released. When you click on one of these movie titles, you display information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movieoverview (summary), and the names of the top five cast members (ie, actors who play in the movie).</p>
